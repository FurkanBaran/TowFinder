# TowFinder

TowFinder is a C# project designed to help users find nearby tow operators based on city and district selection. The project utilizes ASP.NET Core 8.0 and Entity Framework Core for a robust and scalable application. The application follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern to separate concerns and ensure a modular and maintainable codebase. This README provides a comprehensive guide to set up and run the project.

## Project Overview

This project was developed as my first C# project, aiming to meet the specific requirements and features requested. Technologies and methodologies were chosen to ensure scalability, maintainability, and ease of deployment.

## Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET Core 8.0**: The primary framework for building the web application.
- **Entity Framework Core**: Used for database operations and management.
- **Bootstrap 5**: For responsive and modern UI design.
- **MySQL**: The relational database management system used to store data.

## Features

- **User-friendly Interface**: Select city and district to find nearby tow operators.
- **Admin Panel**: Admins can approve or reject tow operator registrations.
- **Tow Operator Registration**: Tow operators can register and manage their profiles.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Secure login for admins and tow operators.
- **Dynamic Content Loading**: Use of AJAX to dynamically load districts based on city selection.

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- .NET 8.0 SDK
- Visual Studio 2022 (or later)
- MySQL Server

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/furkanbaran/TowFinder.git
cd TowFinder
```

### Configuration

1. **Database Configuration**: Update the `appsettings.json` file with your MySQL database connection details.

   ```json
   {
     "ConnectionStrings": {
       "DefaultConnection": "Server=YOUR_SERVER;Database=YOUR_DATABASE;User=YOUR_USERNAME;Password=YOUR_PASSWORD;"
     },
     "Logging": {
       "LogLevel": {
         "Default": "Information",
         "Microsoft": "Warning",
         "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
       }
     }
   }
   ```
2. **Default Admin User**

      A default admin user is provided for initial setup and testing purposes. The credentials are as follows:

      - **Username**: admin
      - **Password**: Admin123!

      in [program.cs](program.cs)
      
      It is highly recommended to change the default admin password after the first login to ensure security.

3. **Environment Variables**: Alternatively, you can set up environment variables for sensitive data.

### Restore Dependencies

Restore the project dependencies using the .NET CLI.

```bash
dotnet restore
```

### Apply Migrations

Apply the database migrations to set up the database schema.

```bash
dotnet ef database update
```

### Run the Application

Run the application using the .NET CLI.

```bash
dotnet run
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to see the application in action.

### Project Structure

- **Controllers**: Handle incoming requests and return responses.
- **Models**: Represent the data and business logic.
- **Views**: Define the UI elements and layout.
- **ViewModels**: Transfer data between controllers and views.
- **wwwroot**: Static files such as CSS, JavaScript, and images.
- **Migrations**: Database migration files generated by Entity Framework Core.
- **Data**: Contains the application's DbContext and configuration for Entity Framework Core.
- **Entity**: Defines the application's data models and entity configurations.
